This tutorial applies a spiking neural network to reproduce the PyTorch official tutorial `REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (DQN) TUTORIAL <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html>`_.
Please make sure that you have read the original tutorial and corresponding codes before proceeding.

Change the input
------------------------
In the ANN version, the difference between two adjacent frames of CartPole is directly used as input, and then CNN is used to extract features.
We can also use the same method for the SNN version.
However, to obtain the frames, the graphical interface must be activated,
which is not convenient for training on a remote server without a graphical interface.
To reduce the difficulty, we directly use CartPole's state variables as the network input, which is an array containing 4 floating numbers,
i.e., `Cart Position`, `Cart Velocity`, `Pole Angle` and `Pole Velocity At Tip`.
The training code also needs to be changed accordingly, which will be shown below.

Next, we need to define the SNN structure.
Usually in Deep Q Learning, the neural network acts as the Q function, the output of which should be continuous values.
This means that the last layer of the SNN should not output spikes representing Q function as 0 and 1, which may lead to poor performance.
There are several methods to making SNN output continuous values.
For the classification tasks in the previous tutorials, the final output of the network is the firing rate of each neuron in the output layer,
which is obtained by counting the number of spikes in the simulation duration and then dividing the number by the duration.
Through preliminary testing, we found that using firing rate as Q function can not lead to satisfying performance.
Because after simulating  :math:`T` steps, the possible firing rates are :math:`0, \frac{1}{T}, \frac{2}{T}, ..., 1`,
which are not enough to represent the Q function.

Here, we apply a new method to make SNN output floating numbers. We set the firing threshold of a neuron to be infinity, which won't fire at all,
and we adopt the final membrane potential to represent Q function. It is convenient to implement such neurons in the ``SpikingJelly`` framework: just inherit everything from LIF neuron ``neuron.LIFNode`` and rewrite its ``forward`` function.

.. code-block:: python

    class NonSpikingLIFNode(neuron.LIFNode):
        def forward(self, dv: torch.Tensor):
            self.neuronal_charge(dv)
            # self.neuronal_fire()
            # self.neuronal_reset()
            return self.v

The structure of the Deep Q Spiking Network is very simple: input layer, IF neuron layer, and NonSpikingLIF neuron layer,
between which are fully linear connections.
The IF neuron layer is an encoder to convert the CartPole's state variables to spikes,
and the NonSpikingLIF neuron layer can be regraded as the decision making unit.

.. code-block:: python

    class DQSN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, T=16):
            super().__init__()
            self.fc = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
                neuron.IFNode(),
                nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size),
                NonSpikingLIFNode(tau=2.0)
            )

            self.T = T

        def forward(self, x):
            for t in range(self.T):
                self.fc(x)
                
            return self.fc[-1].v


Training the network
---------------------------
The code of this part is almost the same with the ANN version.
But note that the SNN version here adopts ``Observation`` returned by ``env`` as the input.

Following is the training code of the ANN version:

.. code-block:: python

    for i_episode in range(num_episodes):
        # Initialize the environment and state
        env.reset()
        last_screen = get_screen()
        current_screen = get_screen()
        state = current_screen - last_screen
        for t in count():
            # Select and perform an action
            action = select_action(state)
            _, reward, done, _ = env.step(action.item())
            reward = torch.tensor([reward], device=device)

            # Observe new state
            last_screen = current_screen
            current_screen = get_screen()
            if not done:
                next_state = current_screen - last_screen
            else:
                next_state = None

            # Store the transition in memory
            memory.push(state, action, next_state, reward)

            # Move to the next state
            state = next_state

            # Perform one step of the optimization (on the target network)
            optimize_model()
            if done:
                episode_durations.append(t + 1)
                plot_durations()
                break
        # Update the target network, copying all weights and biases in DQN
        if i_episode % TARGET_UPDATE == 0:
            target_net.load_state_dict(policy_net.state_dict())

Here is training code of the SNN version.
During the training process, we will save the model parameters responsible for the largest reward.

.. code-block:: python

    for i_episode in range(num_episodes):
        # Initialize the environment and state
        env.reset()
        state = torch.zeros([1, n_states], dtype=torch.float, device=device)

        total_reward = 0

        for t in count():
            action = select_action(state, steps_done)
            steps_done += 1
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action.item())
            total_reward += reward
            next_state = torch.from_numpy(next_state).float().to(device).unsqueeze(0)
            reward = torch.tensor([reward], device=device)

            if done:
                next_state = None

            memory.push(state, action, next_state, reward)

            state = next_state
            if done and total_reward > max_reward:
                max_reward = total_reward
                torch.save(policy_net.state_dict(), max_pt_path)
                print(f'max_reward={max_reward}, save models')

            optimize_model()

            if done:
                print(f'Episode: {i_episode}, Reward: {total_reward}')
                writer.add_scalar('Spiking-DQN-state-' + env_name + '/Reward', total_reward, i_episode)
                break

        if i_episode % TARGET_UPDATE == 0:
            target_net.load_state_dict(policy_net.state_dict())

It should be emphasized here that, we need to ``reset`` the network after each forward process,
because SNN is retentive while each trial should be started with a clean network state.

.. code-block:: python

    def select_action(state, steps_done):
        ...
        if sample > eps_threshold:
            with torch.no_grad():
                ac = policy_net(state).max(1)[1].view(1, 1)
                functional.reset_net(policy_net)
        ...

    def optimize_model():
        ...
        state_action_values = policy_net(state_batch).gather(1, action_batch)

        next_state_values = torch.zeros(BATCH_SIZE, device=device)
        next_state_values[non_final_mask] = target_net(non_final_next_states).max(1)[0].detach()
        functional.reset_net(target_net)
        ...
        optimizer.step()
        functional.reset_net(policy_net)

The integrated script can be found here `activation_based/examples/Spiking_DQN_state.py <https://github.com/fangwei123456/spikingjelly/blob/master/spikingjelly/activation_based/examples/Spiking_DQN_state.py>`_.
And we can start the training process in a Python Console as follows.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from spikingjelly.activation_based.examples import Spiking_DQN_state
    >>> Spiking_DQN_state.train(use_cuda=False, model_dir='./model/CartPole-v0', log_dir='./log', env_name='CartPole-v0', hidden_size=256, num_episodes=500, seed=1)
    ...
    Episode: 509, Reward: 715
    Episode: 510, Reward: 3051
    Episode: 511, Reward: 571
    complete
    state_dict path is./ policy_net_256.pt

Testing the network
---------------------------
After training for 512 episodes, we download the model ``policy_net_256_max.pt`` that maximizes the reward during the training process from the server,
and run the ``play`` function on a local machine with a graphical interface to test its performance.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from spikingjelly.activation_based.examples import Spiking_DQN_state
    >>> Spiking_DQN_state.play(use_cuda=False, pt_path='./model/CartPole-v0/policy_net_256_max.pt', env_name='CartPole-v0', hidden_size=256, played_frames=300)

The trained SNN controls the left or right movement of the CartPole, until the end of the game or the number of continuous frames exceeds ``played_frames``.
During the simulation, the ``play`` function will draw the firing rate of the IF neuron,
and the voltages of the NonSpikingLIF neurons in the output layer at the last moment, which directly determine the movement of the CartPole.
